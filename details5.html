        <p>The U-2 Spy Plane Incident occurred on May 1, 1960, during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. An American U-2 spy plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile while conducting aerial reconnaissance over Soviet territory.</p>
        <p>The incident caused a major international crisis and heightened tensions between the two superpowers. The United States initially denied the true purpose of the U-2 flight, claiming it was a weather research aircraft that had strayed off course.</p>
        <p>However, the Soviet Union revealed that they had captured Powers alive and recovered wreckage of the U-2 aircraft. The incident led to the cancellation of a planned summit meeting between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.</p>
        <p>The U-2 Spy Plane Incident highlighted the dangers of aerial espionage and contributed to the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations during the Cold War.</p>
