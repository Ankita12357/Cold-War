    <h1>Berlin Blockade</h1>
    <div class="content1">
      <p>The Berlin Blockade was a Soviet attempt to starve out the allies in Berlin in order to gain supremacy. It lasted from June 24, 1948, to May 12, 1949, and was a crucial event in the early stages of the Cold War.</p>

      <p>Following World War II, Berlin was divided into four zones, controlled by the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Tensions between the Soviet Union and the Western allies escalated, leading to the blockade.</p>

      <p>The Western allies responded with the Berlin Airlift, an operation to supply food, fuel, and other necessities to the people of West Berlin by air. The airlift lasted for over a year and demonstrated the resolve of the Western powers to protect their interests in Berlin.</p>
      
      <p>Despite the hardships faced during the blockade, the citizens of West Berlin remained resilient, and the Berlin Airlift became a symbol of hope and solidarity. Pilots from various nations, including the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, participated in the airlift, making it one of the largest humanitarian efforts in history.</p>
      
      <p>The Berlin Blockade ended on May 12, 1949, when the Soviet Union lifted the blockade. The event solidified the division between East and West and marked the beginning of the Cold War. It also led to the formation of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) in 1949, as Western powers sought to counter Soviet aggression and ensure the security of Europe.</p>
      
      <p>The legacy of the Berlin Blockade continues to shape international relations and serves as a reminder of the challenges faced during the Cold War era.</p>
