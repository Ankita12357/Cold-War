    <div class="content2">
        <p>The Marshall Plan, officially known as the European Recovery Program, was an American initiative aimed at providing economic aid to Western Europe to help rebuild economies devastated by World War II. It was named after Secretary of State George Marshall. The plan offered over $12 billion in assistance to 16 European countries and played a crucial role in the economic recovery of Western Europe. The Marshall Plan also had geopolitical implications, as it aimed to prevent the spread of communism in the region by fostering economic stability and strengthening ties with the United States.</p>
