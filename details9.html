        <p>The Arms Race was a defining feature of the Cold War period, spanning from 1947 to 1991. It was characterized by a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to develop and stockpile nuclear weapons, as well as conventional military capabilities, in a bid to maintain or gain strategic advantage.</p>
        <p>Both superpowers engaged in a relentless pursuit of military superiority, investing heavily in research, development, and production of advanced weaponry and delivery systems. This competition extended beyond nuclear arms to include advancements in missile technology, space exploration, and other military innovations.</p>
        <p>The Arms Race led to an unprecedented buildup of nuclear arsenals, with both sides amassing thousands of warheads capable of inflicting catastrophic destruction. The fear of mutually assured destruction (MAD) became a central deterrent against direct conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Throughout the Cold War, the Arms Race fueled tensions between the superpowers and contributed to various crises, including the Cuban Missile Crisis and the brinkmanship of the early 1980s. It also had profound economic implications, diverting resources away from social programs and exacerbating Cold War rivalries.</p>
        <p>The Arms Race finally came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, marking the conclusion of one of the most enduring and consequential rivalries in modern history.</p>
