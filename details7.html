        <p>The Prague Spring was a period of political liberalization and social reform in Czechoslovakia that took place during the era of the Cold War. It began on January 5, 1968, when Alexander Dubček became the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and lasted until August 21, 1968, when the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries invaded the country to suppress the reforms.</p>
        <p>During the Prague Spring, Czechoslovakia experienced a period of political openness and cultural flourishing known as "socialism with a human face." Dubček's government introduced reforms aimed at increasing political and economic freedom, decentralizing power, and improving human rights.</p>
        <p>However, the reforms initiated by Dubček's government alarmed the Soviet leadership, which feared losing control over Czechoslovakia and the Eastern Bloc. In response, on August 20, 1968, Soviet-led Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia, bringing an end to the Prague Spring and reinstalling a pro-Soviet government.</p>
        <p>The suppression of the Prague Spring led to a period of normalization in Czechoslovakia, characterized by the reversal of reforms and the strengthening of Soviet influence. However, the events of the Prague Spring left a lasting impact on Czechoslovakia and inspired future movements for political reform and democratization.</p>
