        <p>The Sino-Soviet Split was a significant ideological and geopolitical conflict between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China during the 1960s. The split emerged from differences in interpretation of Marxist theory and the conduct of international communism.</p>
        <p>Despite their shared communist ideology, tensions between the two countries escalated over various issues, including leadership of the international communist movement, border disputes, and competing visions of socialism.</p>
        <p>The split led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and China, and both sides engaged in hostile propaganda campaigns against each other. The Chinese government under Mao Zedong criticized the Soviet Union for its perceived revisionism and betrayal of Marxist principles.</p>
        <p>The Sino-Soviet Split had significant repercussions on the global balance of power during the Cold War, as it weakened the unity of the communist bloc and reshaped international alliances.</p>
