        <p>The Soviet-Afghan War was a conflict fought between Soviet-led Afghan forces and various Afghan opposition groups, known as the Mujahideen, from December 24, 1979, to February 15, 1989. The war was triggered by the Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan to support the communist government against insurgent factions.</p>
        <p>The Soviet intervention was met with fierce resistance from the Mujahideen, who received support from a variety of sources, including the United States, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. The conflict became a proxy war between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War.</p>
        <p>The Soviet-Afghan War resulted in significant casualties on both sides and had far-reaching consequences for Afghanistan and the region. The Mujahideen's successful resistance contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1989.</p>
        <p>However, the power vacuum left by the Soviet withdrawal led to continued instability and conflict in Afghanistan, culminating in the rise of the Taliban and the subsequent U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.</p>
